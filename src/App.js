/*========= Planning the route configuration (#1)========== */
//Number one:
//The homepage can be setup as a single Route component for the path /
//Number two:
//The poem pages are not as straightforward (we don't want to make a new component for every poem)
//It'd be better if we can store the poem list in a JS array & then only use one PoemPage component that can display any poem
//Number three:
//We don't want to add a Route instance for each poem as well
//It'd be better to add one Route instance & somewhow make it work for every poem
//Number four:
//There are no React Router Routes setup yet only <a> tags instead of Links
// There's also a component called PoemPage which isn't being used yet

/*========================================== */

/*======= The homepage (#1) ====== */
//#1
//Import Route
//Swap hard-coded PoemListPage instance for a Route to an exact path of /
//Make sure there is an exact prop to let the Route component know that we only want to show PoemListPage as the exact component
//App.js ===> PoemListPage.js

/*========================================== */

/*======= Using Link Components (#1) ====== */
//Navgiation without page reload:
//We'll change all instances of <a> to use Link from react-router-dom
//1st we can swap a in App.js inside <nav>
//App.js ===> PoemListPage.js
